1:- Problem Statement: Create a method that takes in two hashes as parameters and returns a new hash that merges the two hashes, but only includes key-value pairs where the value is an integer greater than 10.

2:- Problem statement: 
    You have been given two hashes hash1 and hash2. Both hashes contain key-value pairs of strings. 
    You need to write a Ruby program that merges the two hashes and returns a new hash. If the two hashes have the same key, the value in the new hash should be the concatenation of the values from both hashes.

3:- Problem Statement: Write a program that takes a list of words as input and returns the word with the highest frequency

4:- Problem Statement: Write a program that randomly shuffles a hash and returns the shuffled hash.

5:- Problem statement: You are given a hash containing student names as keys and their respective scores as values. Write a method    that takes this hash as input and returns the name of the student with the highest score.

6:- Problem statement: 

Create a program that takes a list of student names and their corresponding scores as input. Calculate the average score for each student and store it in a hash. Sort the hash by average score in descending order and display the student names along with their average scores.

1 : ==>>

Given a nested hash representing a company's employee data, write a method that takes in the hash and returns the total number of employees in the company.

Example Input:
company_data = 
            {
                engineering: { engineers: 10, managers: 3 },
                marketing: { marketers: 6, managers: 2 }
            }

2:- 
Create a nested hash structure in Ruby that represents a car dealership. The dealership has multiple locations, each of which has multiple car brands, and each brand has multiple car models. Include information such as the price and available colors for each car model.

    Calculate the average price of all car models in the dealership.
    Calculate the total number of car models available in all locations.
    Calculate the number of different car brands available in each location.
    Calculate the total number of available colors for all car models.
    Calculate the total revenue if all cars in the dealership are sold at their listed prices..

3:
    Create a hash representing a company's employees and their departments. The key is the department name and the value is another hash containing the employee name as key and their job title as value. Your task is to write a method that returns a list of all job titles for a given department.

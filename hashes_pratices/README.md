1:- Problem Statement: Create a method that takes in two hashes as parameters and returns a new hash that merges the two hashes, but only includes key-value pairs where the value is an integer greater than 10.

2:- Problem statement: 
    You have been given two hashes hash1 and hash2. Both hashes contain key-value pairs of strings. 
    You need to write a Ruby program that merges the two hashes and returns a new hash. If the two hashes have the same key, the value in the new hash should be the concatenation of the values from both hashes.

3:- Problem Statement: Write a program that takes a list of words as input and returns the word with the highest frequency

4:- Problem Statement: Write a program that randomly shuffles a hash and returns the shuffled hash.

5:- Problem statement: You are given a hash containing student names as keys and their respective scores as values. Write a method    that takes this hash as input and returns the name of the student with the highest score.

6:- Problem statement: 

Create a program that takes a list of student names and their corresponding scores as input. Calculate the average score for each student and store it in a hash. Sort the hash by average score in descending order and display the student names along with their average scores.

Bidirectional Association Between Author and Book:

Problem: Implement two classes, Author and Book. Each Author can have multiple Books, and each Book is associated with one Author. Ensure that when a Book is added to an Author, the Book's author attribute is set automatically.
Coding Task: Code the Author and Book classes with the necessary attributes and methods. Demonstrate the bidirectional association by creating an Author, adding Books to this author, and showing that each Book's author attribute is set correctly.
